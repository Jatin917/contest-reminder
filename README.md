Contest Reminder - MERN Stack Project (TypeScript)
Overview
Contest Reminder is a full-stack web application built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) and TypeScript. It helps users track upcoming and past coding contests from Codeforces, CodeChef, and Leetcode.

It also provides an automated system to attach solution links from a YouTube channel and enables users to filter, bookmark, and manage contests easily.

Features
‚úÖ Fetch upcoming contests from Codeforces, CodeChef, and Leetcode
‚úÖ Show contest date and time remaining before the contest starts
‚úÖ Display past contests with attached solution links
‚úÖ Platform-based filtering to select contests from one or multiple platforms
‚úÖ Bookmark contests for future reference
‚úÖ Attach solution links manually via a form
‚úÖ Auto-fetch YouTube solutions using Google API when a new video is uploaded
‚úÖ Built with TypeScript for better type safety and maintainability

Tech Stack
Frontend: React.js (TypeScript), Vite, Tailwind CSS
Backend: Node.js, Express.js (TypeScript)
Database: MongoDB
API Integration: Google Developer Console (YouTube API), Clist.by API
State Management: React Context API
How It Works
Fetching Contests
Upcoming Contests are fetched directly on the frontend via Clist.by API.
Past Contests are fetched in the backend using a polling mechanism. If a contest already exists in the database, it won't be added again.
YouTube Integration
The server polls the YouTube API every minute to check for new uploads.
If a new video is detected, its title is checked against past contests in the database.
If a matching contest is found, the solution link is automatically attached to that contest.
